    <h3>About me</h3>
    <img src="assets/images/img.JPG" alt="Lan photo" style="width:300px;height:300px;">

    <p>I’m Lan. I live in Seattle with my husband Michael and my Shih Tzu Coconut Chip. That is the most important fact about me but if you’re interested in the details, see below:
      
      <p>I grew up in Vietnam until I was 16 years old. Then I came to Michigan as a high school exchange student and ended up finishing my degree in Supply Chain Management from Michigan State University (GO GREEN!). I have always worked a small job and taken internship during the summer for most of my college career. In addition to my GPA of 3.8, I believe those internships with HP and MeadWestvaco helped me scored a job with Microsoft in Seattle. 
      I worked at Microsoft for about 3.5 years and learned some epic lessons and made some rookie mistake during a holiday season (Eeek! No worries, mistake was fixed and lesson was learned). I learned that old school manufacturing wasn’t for me so I took a chance and got a job at Amazon.com in 2012. I still often asked myself how they hired me (lol). But lucky for them, I delivered a bunch of results and worked on projects from fulfillment cost reduction to launching new Prime Now cities and managing a billion plus category. 
      Anyhow, you’d think I’d stay as a business woman for the rest of my life benefiting from the company brand name and the golden handcuff (holy cow Amazon stocks!). But no, here I am learning how to code and I’m regularly banging my head and yell into empty space in an attempt to push myself. </p>
      
      Cheers to the unknown future ahead of me and of us, my classmates. <strong>But hey, we’ll figure it out.</strong> </p>

      <p>Fun facts about me. This is about as interesting about me as it's going to get folks</p>
      <ul>
          <li>I like to name pets after food name (i.e. Coconut Chip and Madelene Cotton Ball Cucumber my late guinea pig).</li>
          <li>I like to bake and garden.</li>
          <li>I speak English and Vietnamese fluently and often pretend I speak French as well (un petit peu!)</li>
          <li>I love to eat (LOVE IT). I strongly believe eating off my husband plate then those are calories free (hooray). </li>
          <li>I’m a shoes addict. (But hey, I admitted my poison, what’s yours?)</li>
      </ul>
